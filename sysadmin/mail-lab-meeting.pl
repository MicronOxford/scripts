## Short script to send automatic email notifications about upcoming lab
## meeting. Checks a wiki page with the syntax:
##
## * yyyy/mm/dd - speaker name
## * yyyy/mm/dd - speaker name
## * yyyy/mm/dd
## * yyyy/mm/dd - speaker name
##
## == subscriptions ==
## * email address
## * email address
## * email address
## * email address
##
## and on the day before the meeting will send an email to everyone. To send
## emails about a normal date for a meeting that will no happen, simply leave
## empty after date.
##
## This script uses Email::Sender::Simple which requires sendmail to be
## properly configured in the system. Obvioulsy, it also requires access
## to the wiki which may not be true if the wiki is not accessible outside
## the network.
